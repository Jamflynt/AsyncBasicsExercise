11/2/21 Async Basics Exercise

Complete the following in the JS file (You can either change the code or comment it out and write it again)...<br>
1. Add a callback to the “luke” function so the value of `Mark Hamill` will display in the terminal/console for the name1 variable when the lukeName function is run.<br>
2. Create a promise in the han function (Put the setTimeout inside the function with the resolve and reject parameters that is passed into the Promise). Also, consume the promise that is now returned from the han function in a way that the value of `Harrison Ford` will display in the terminal/console for the name2 variable when the hanName function is run.<br>
3. Use a promise in the leia function (Put the setTimeout inside the function with the resolve and reject parameters that is passed into the Promise). Also, use Async/Await so the value of `Carrie Fisher` will display in the terminal/console for the name3 variable when the leiaName function is run.<br>
